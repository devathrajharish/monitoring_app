It failed at 2025-06-13T10:00:00 with the error: `org.apache.spark.SparkException: Job aborted due to stage failure`.\n\n### Suggested Fix:\n1. **Investigate the Stage Failure**: The error indicates a stage failure in Spark. Check the Spark logs for any task failures or errors that might have caused the stage to fail.\n2. **Common Causes**: \n   - Data Skew: Check if there's data skew causing some tasks to take significantly longer.\n   - Resource Allocation: Ensure that the cluster has enough resources to handle the job.\n   - Faulty Code: Review the transformations and actions in the Spark job for any potential issues.\n\nIf you have more specific logs or stack traces, I can provide a more detailed solution.",
