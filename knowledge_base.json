    "error": "Token expired",
    "fix": "The error \"Token expired\" typically indicates that an authentication token used to access a service or resource has expired and needs to be refreshed or renewed. Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Refresh the Token:**\n   - If your system supports token refresh, initiate a token refresh process. This often involves using a refresh token to obtain a new access token without requiring user interaction.\n\n2. **Increase Token Expiry Time:**\n   - If possible, adjust the token settings to increase the expiry time. This might involve changing settings in the identity provider or authentication server.\n\n3. **Automate Token Renewal:**\n   - Implement a mechanism in your pipeline to automatically renew tokens before they expire. This can be done by scheduling token refresh operations at regular intervals.\n\n4. **Check Token Issuance Process:**\n   - Ensure that the process issuing the token is functioning correctly and is configured to provide tokens with the appropriate lifespan.\n\n5. **Review Authentication Configuration:**\n   - Verify that the authentication configuration in your pipeline is correct and up-to-date. This includes checking client IDs, secrets, and any other credentials used for token generation.\n\n6. **Monitor Token Usage:**\n   - Implement monitoring to track token usage and expiry. This can help identify patterns or issues with token management.\n\n7. **Consult Documentation:**\n   - Review the documentation for the service or API you are accessing to understand how tokens are managed and what the best practices are for handling token expiration",
